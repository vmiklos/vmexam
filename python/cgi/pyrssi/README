= WAP Interface for Irssi
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>

== What's pyrssi?

pyrssi is a successor for irssi-mobile. It provides a WAP interface so that you
can control your client from your mobile phone.

== Why is it better than irssi-mobile?

- handles private messaging (that was the most important for me)

- it allows you do anything, join/part channels, op, kick, etc.

- it fetches the last lines from the window's buffer so that you'll see
  everything you see in your client, including joins/quits, /names output, etc.

- it uses a unix socket, rather than a port, which is quite useful in multiuser
  environment

- other reasons I forgot ;)

== How does it work?

First you need (my improved version of) socket-interface.pl so that you'll have
a socket in your ~/.irssi/socket. Then you need pyrssi.py, that cgi will
connect to the socket and will generate the wap pages.

Don't forget to edit the bottom of pyrssi.py: the sha1sum of your password and
the socket path!

== FAQ

'Q: How frequent does it refresh?'

``A: It does not. If you send an empty text then it will.''

'Q: My window list is looooong. Is it possible to switch between windows
without listing all of them?'

``A: Yes, just use /g windownum or /g #channelname.''

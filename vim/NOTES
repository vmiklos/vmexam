Random vim notes...

== Folding

Without any additional markup, all C blocks are unfolded. You can change this
temporarily with:

- zc (fold close) folds the current block
- zo (fold open) opens the current fold
- za (fold auto) toggles between the two automatically

== Hex editing

Given a binary file:

- :%!xxd turns binary into a hex dump
- :%!xxd -r turns this back into binary

Given a hexdump (raw one, except newlines):

- :%!xxd -r -p turns this back to binary

# vmexam - Miklos' code Examples

This repo is my random collection of notes and code chunks that are too small to have their own
repo. The name refers to <https://linux.die.net/man/1/soxexam> and my name.

Many subdirectories have their own README files. Particularly interesting are a few tools which I
actually use on a daily basis:

- darcs-git: a darcs-like wrapper around git
- ics2txt: .ics file printer for mutt
- nextcloud-open: open certain files in your browser, based on your local nextcloud sync tree
- addr-osmify: annotate postal addresses with GPS coordinates
- tpconv: convert between typographical units
- weesearch: search in weechat logs

SGD is Super Grub2 Disk, http://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/

I had to deal with a machine with broken RAID1 support in its BIOS, the
workaround was to create a third drive that didn't do anything other than
loading Grub2 itself and reading the config file from the mirror.

The sgd_custom.cfg in this dir has to be dropped to the menus/ directory of
the SGD source code, then ./supergrub-meta-mkrescue can produce a
super_grub2_disk_hybrid_<version>.iso that can be copied to the third (boot)
drive.

Additionally, the custom config enables serial support in Grub2.

Tested SGD version: 2.00s2.

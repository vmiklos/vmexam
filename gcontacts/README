This is intended to be a drop-in replacement for goocaa[1].

The only problem with goocaa is that it uses the ClientLogin API, which was
shut down[2] on April 20, 2015.

As an additional feature, the lcontacts script can read data from your own
LDAP, and write similar output, so gcontacts can search in both your Google and
LDAP contacts.

Another goodie is the VIM integration, when ft=mail code completion searches in
your address book.

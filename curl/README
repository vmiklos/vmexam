dl_pure vs dl
=============

1) dl produces a progressbar, dl_pure doesn't.
2) 'dl_pure http://foo.com/bar ./' will produce an error:
'could not open file for writing: Is a directory'.
'dl http://foo.com/bar ./' will produce a file named 'baz'.
yes, 'baz' is hardcoded! ;-)

up_pure vs up
==============

'up foo ftp://bar.org/incoming' will produce 'ftp://bar.org/incoming/foo'.
'up_pure foo ftp://bar.org/incoming' will produce
'ftp://bar.org/incoming/(nil)'.

post_pure vs post
=================

there is no post_pure and there is post ;-P

ah, for testing post, here is a simple php:
<?php
	if(isset($_POST['foo']))
	{
		$fp = fopen(sha1(mt_rand( 1, 1000000000 )), "w");
		fwrite($fp, $_POST['foo']);
		fclose($fp);
	}
?>

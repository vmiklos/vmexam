Rust version of addr-osmify, mainly just because I wanted to practice Rurst on
something real-word. Error handling is just panic all over the place to keep
the code short.

Pedantic error handling could be done like this:

- return Result everywhere, as described in
  <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html>
- use Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> to mix multiple error types (example
  is for void functions)
- <https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/should-noneerror-implement-the-error-trait/6312/5>
  mentions that ok_or() can turn a non-Error Option<> error into an Error

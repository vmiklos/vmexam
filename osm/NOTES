Ideas what to do in your region:

- check for streets without house numbers at all
- check for suspicious streets, which have house numbers, but they are incomplete (if you have a reference house number list -- geocodes are not needed)
- check for valid postcodes
- check for your osmose errors
- check for addr:interpolation -> in progress for Sasad, then could also check Gazdagr√©t

== Efforts

- list of streets in a region:

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_API_by_Example#List_of_Streets

- list of street - house number pairs in a region:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/openstreetmap-hungary/FjApwcAh154/gKSXc2j3cFMJ

Ideas what to do in your region:

- check for streets without house numbers at all
- check for suspicious streets, which have house numbers, but they are incomplete (if you have a reference house number list -- geocodes are not needed)
- check for valid postcodes
- check for your osmose errors
- check for addr:interpolation -> could also check GazdagrÃ©t
- check for missing maxspeed tags -> in progress for Sasad

What to collect next to house numbers:

- maxspeed=
- surface=asphalt
- highway=stop/give_way
- barrier=bollard
- oneway=yes
- turn restrictions
- highway=steps
- highway=crossing, crossing=traffic_signals/uncontrolled
- traffic_calming=bump

== Historic data

Overpass supports this as well, just need to include that in the first line of the query, e.g. replace:

----
[timeout:425]
----

with:

----
[timeout:425] [date:"2015-01-06T00:00:00Z"]
----

to query the non-latest version.

This is kind of my C++ "daily WTF".

The question is always the same: "what will be the output"?

0: You would expect that the output is a compile error, but given that
Tmp::foo() is never called, the compiler won't say that calling run() on an
int* is an error.

(See <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183108/is-object-code-generated-for-unused-template-class-methods>.)

1: You would expect that the output is "foo1", but it's "oo", as +1 increments the pointer to "foo".

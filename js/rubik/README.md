# Rubik solver, browser side

## What does this do?

This is a simple Rubik cube solver, where the emphasis is on allowing you to paint a cube based on a
real-world, scrambled cube and then showing the steps to solve the cube.

## Motivation

The motivation is to return to the solved state while you learn solving the cube yourself, so you
never need to physically disassemble the cube while practicing.

## Credits

The code builds on top of [Joe's rubik-js.git](https://github.com/joews/rubik-js) for visualization,
and uses [my rubik solver
service](https://github.com/vmiklos/vmexam/blob/master/share-vmiklos-hu-apps/src/rubik.rs) to solve
the cube.

In other words, this is free software and a browser version of the [Cube
Solver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeffprod.cubesolver) Android app.
